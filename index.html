<p>This is new Repo</p>
<!--First of all created a new folder in the GitDemo And named as LocalRepo,In order to create it mkdir folder name and then change directory to LocalRepo like cd LocalRepo and then we need to initialise the git because there will be only two hidden files.In order to see hidden files we need to use command ls -a and then we will initilaise git using git init and then we add files what ever needed in our repo and add and commit the changes-->
