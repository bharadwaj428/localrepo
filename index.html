<p>This is new Repo</p>
<p>First of all created a new folder in the GitDemo And named as LocalRepo,
  In order to create it mkdir folder name and then change directory to LocalRepo like cd LocalRepo and then we need to initialise the git because there will be only two hidden files.
  In order to see hidden files we need to use command ls -a and then we will initilaise git using git init and then we add files what ever needed in our repo and add and commit the changes 
  and then we create a new repository in github with no files and then in order to add our files to github 
  first we need to add the path to it like git remote add origin path and then we need to check the branch by default the branch name is master so we need to convert to main and then push to the github by using git push -u origin main -u stands for upstream means when ever if there is alot of work in the same project then we can provide once and we can directly write git push.
And then we have created another branches like git checkout -b new branch and then new branch will be created
and then we can switch to branches like git checkout branch name and then finally we need to merge changes need to be updated and in order to change the conflicts in our local system we need to pull into local system like 
git pull origin main, In order to merge we can directly do in github by using pull Requests and another way 
is by using git Bash terminal we can see the difference using git diff branch name and then to merge 
git merge branch name </p>
